This is the Practice and Final Project for course 'SQL for Data Science' which is 'Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization'

This repository comprises of CSVS from where I imported the Data, the database and the SQL Script.

I used DBEAVER for this project and SQLite as the Database.

P - Practice Assesment which is from P1-P7 in the script.
F - Final Assessment which is from F1-F10 in the script.

If you wanna learn SQL, try the course, and if know the basics then to download CSVS and answer the Questions.
Its helpful for the learners, who are starting the SQL learning Jouney
